# Tests
Before pushing code to the repository, run these tests and make sure they all pass. To run the tests from the command line, cd into the project root directory. Then run:

`pytest tests` 

Make sure you have Pytest installed. To install Pytest and other project dependencies, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
